You cannot use reserved words as variable names/identifiers:
    False   class   return  is      finally
    None    if      for     lambda  continue
    True    def     from    while   nonlocal
    and     del     global  not     with
    as      elif    try     or      yield
    assert  else    import  pass
    break   except  in      raise

Variables:
    named place where programmers can store data and later retrive the data using the variable name
    Can choose the name
    Can change the value of the variable

Variable Name Rules:
    Must start with a letter or underscore (underscore at start usually only used for variables specifically to talk to python)
    Must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores
    Case Sensitive
        Good:       spam    eggs    spam23  _speed
        Bad:        23spam  #sign   var.12
        Different:  spam    Spam    SPAM

Best Practice:
    Name variables to help us remember what we intend to store in them (mnemonic = memory aid)
