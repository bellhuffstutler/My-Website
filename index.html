								<p>I have over 15 years using various Linux-based operating systems (I am currently using Arch Linux as my daily driver) and I have spent 5 of those as a power user, working with BASH scripting and remote server work. Currently, I am running an Open Source microblogging service called Mastodon. It is running on a remote server running Ubuntu, and I do upkeep on the server, as well as updating to the code (Ruby-on-rails, SCSS, HTML, Javascript) when there is a feature that I need to implement that isn't implemented in the main repo for the service.</p> 

								<p>I also work regularly with Git, both with Mastodon and my own personal projects, and am familiar with both Git and SSH. I am looking to move more into a programming role, simply because the Mastodon server doesn't pay the bills, and I would like to use the skills that I've learned throughout my life instead of just using them for hobbies or personal projects.</p> 
									
								<p>My job history is very customer-focused, and I enjoy helping people with problem solving and troubleshooting, and I spend a lot of my free time helping on the freeCodeCamp forums or looking for open source software to contribute to.</p> 
									
								<p>If you think I would be a good fit for your company or your project, please reach out! You can fill out the contact form, and I will be more than happy to get back to you within 2 business days!</p>

								<p>I am currently a Software Engineer with #100Devs, and am learning the ins and outs of Full-Stack Development. I spend a lot of time researching, as well as tinkering with various smaller projects while looking for bigger projects to start, and also contributing to Open Source Software.</p>
								<p>Recently I have been doing a lot of Front-End work, specifically with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you would like to see some of my projects, you can check out my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/bellhuffstutler">here</a>. You can also check out live versions of my projects live on the site, just check out the Projects section <a href="#projects">here</a>!</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hihi! I'm Beloise and I love coffee, raccoons, and GNU/Linux operating systems! I've been playing with and learning about computers since I was 12 (anyone remember AOL disks?) and I'm a big fan of emo music. Blame the early 00's for that I suppose. I like to play games to decompress after a hard day's work, and in general like to meet new people and talk. I am also learning Japanese, it's been a thing I've been trying to do for a while, and I'm finally taking it seriously! If you wanna chat about Open Source Software, or just like raccoons, you can also find me on Twitter! It's a great place to get to know me and I use it to find lots of new people.Check it out <a href="https://twitter.com/fullstackracc">here</a>!</p>
